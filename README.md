ENGR 290 CONCORDIA
Winter 2023
Autonomous Hovercraft

We have built an autonomous hovercraft for our ENGR 290 project class.

We used the following parts:
1)Arduino NANO
2)UltraSonic Sensor (2)
3)IMU (Gyroscope)
4)Lift Fan
5)Thrust Fan
6)Servo motor
7)450 mAh battery (2)

We aim to finish a 8 meter long track with turns in under 2 minutes. 

We are using several functions to implement the IMU in relation with the servo motor to cancel out the rotation caused by the lift fan.
